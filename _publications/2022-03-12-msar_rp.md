Background
-----

- Recurrent patients (RP), also known as frequent flyers, high utilizers, or super users in hospitals, are a **small** group; however, they impose a **disproportionately high** utilization of resources.

- Two major types of reasons reported from literature: 1. mental health or substance (drug and/or alcohol) abuse  2. Some chronic diseases such as AIDS

- Social-behavioral interventions and outpatient care could be introduced to reduce future recurrent visits.

- No standardized criteria on identify RP, lack of tools on selecting top reasons associated with recurrent visits.


Objectives: identify RP & rank top factors associated with recurrent visits
-----

1. identify high utilizers / recurrent patients
2. interpretable method to identify top-X (from on avg. 7+ from past visits) comorbidities associated with their frequent visits

Observation: Confidence-Support trade-offs
- Some comorbidities reported by literature that are highly associated with recurrent visits have relatively low support/prevalence

- Increasing the number of comorbidities n will increase confidence while decreasing support.

Limitations of existing ML approaches
----
1. A conventional interpretable Association rules (AR) method
Pick the highest confidence comorbidities combination 
 while its support >= a pre-defined minimum support threshold

    Pros: statistical method, **interpretable** 

    **Main drawback**: potentially eliminate those high-confidence but low support conditions

2. It is challenging for conventional ML algorithms such as XGBoost to detect High confidence, low-support comorbidity combinations 

3. It is a hard problem from ML perspective: no ground truth labels on important factors;
Limited features (combination of comorbidities) to model recurrent patients accurately.
