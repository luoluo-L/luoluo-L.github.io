Background
-----

- Recurrent patients (RP), also known as frequent flyers, high utilizers, or super users in hospitals, are a **small** group; however, they impose a **disproportionately high** utilization of resources.

- Two major types of reasons reported from literature: 1. mental health or substance (drug and/or alcohol) abuse  2. Some chronic diseases such as AIDS

- Social-behavioral interventions and outpatient care could be introduced to reduce future recurrent visits.

- No standardized criteria on identify RP, lack of tools on selecting top reasons associated with recurrent visits.


Objectives: identify RP & rank top factors associated with recurrent visits
-----

1. identify high utilizers / recurrent patients
2. interpretable method to identify top-X (from on avg. 7+ from past visits) comorbidities associated with their frequent visits
