Notes for reading paper: learning and evaluating representations for deep one-class classification [paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02578).

One class classification identifies if an example is the same distribution as training data or not.

* anomaly detection
* outlier detection
* in case of lack of data (not compariable quality) from negative class such as lack of amount, variations in negative class

problems of using contrasive loss directly in one-class classification

- Class Collision

  Contrastive loss:
  $L_{cls} = - E_{x, x' ~ P_X A, A'} log\frac{exp(\tau^{-1} \phi^T(A(x)) \phi(A'(x)))}{ \tau^{-1} \phi^T(A(x)) \phi(A'(x))) + \sum_{i 1}^{M -1} \tau^{-1} \phi^T(A(x)) \phi(A'(x_i))) }  \ (1), $
  where
  $x_i \neq x$

  $A$ and $A'$ are identical but independent stochastic augmentation processes for two different realizations of $x$.

  $\phi (\cdot) $ is a normalization function, $s.t$ $\| \phi (\cdot) \| = 1.$

  In summary, $L_{clr}$ regularizes 
  - representations of the same instance with different views $(A(x),A'(x))$ to be similar,
  - those of different instances
  $(A(x),A'(x_i \neq x))$ to be unlike.


  Class collision:
  The contrastive loss in Eq.(1) is minimized by maximizing the distance between representations of negative pairs $(x,x_i),x \neq x_i$, even though they are from the same class when applied to the one-class classification. This seems to contradict to the idea of deep one-class classification,which learns representations by minimizing the distance between representations with respect to the center $E (g ( f(x) ) - c)$. 


  Proposal from this work
  -

  Two step process:
  - Step 1: self-supervised learning 
  $x \rightarrow f(x) \rightarrow g(f(x)) $ over a union of distributions.

  - Step 2: feed step 1 to a shallow one-class classifier (OC-SVM, KDE)
